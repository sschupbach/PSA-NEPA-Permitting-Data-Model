[Accelerator Listing](https://gpsaccelerators.developer.salesforce.com/accelerator/a0wDo000000BBN7IAO/nepa-and-permitting-data-model)


## Description

The NEPA and Permitting Data Model Accelerator helps U.S. federal and state agencies modernize their permitting systems in alignment with the [_**NEPA and Permitting Data and Technology Standard v1.2**_](https://permitting.innovation.gov/CEQ_NEPA_and_Permitting_Data_and_Technology_Standard.pdf) issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) on May 30, 2025 (updated August 18, 2025). Built on the Salesforce Public Sector Solutions (PSS) data model, this Accelerator introduces custom objects and fields to support data interoperability, transparency, and improved decision-making across environmental permitting programs.

This Accelerator is designed to help agencies meet the requirements of the CEQ [**Permitting Technology Action Plan**](https://permitting.innovation.gov) (May 30, 2025), which directs agencies listed under 42 U.S.C. 4370m-1(b)(2)(B)(i)-(xii) to adopt and begin implementing the data standard and Minimum Functional Requirements (MFRs). It supports MFRs #1 (Implement Data Standards), #5 (Automated Case Management Tools), and #7 (Improved Document Management) at foundational and emerging maturity levels.

This Accelerator extends the PSS [**Application and Authorization Data Model**](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.psc_api.meta/psc_api/psc_data_model_application_authorization.htm) by mapping CEQ's defined entities and properties to Salesforce data components. It provides agencies with a concrete starting point to comply with Title II of the Evidence Act and open data guidance outlined in OMB Memorandum [**M-25-05**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/M-25-05-Phase-2-Implementation-of-the-Foundations-for-Evidence-Based-Policymaking-Act-of-2018-Open-Government-Data-Access-and-Management-Guidance.pdf).

![NEPA to Application and Authorization Data Model Mapping](/docs/NEPA%20to%20Salesforce%20Mapping.jpeg)

**Key benefits include**:
- **Compliance out of the box**: Implements 6 of the 9 CEQ standard entities using Salesforce-native components, including all 6 provenance fields required by v1.2.
- **Faster implementation**: Accelerates modernization efforts with ready-made metadata aligned to federal guidance and the August 28, 2025 implementation deadline.
- **Interoperability-first architecture**: Promotes structured, shareable data models that improve transparency and data exchange across agencies. External ID fields on Project and Process support UUID-based agency-to-agency data sharing.
- **Milestone and engagement tracking**: Extends PSS `ApplicationTimeline` for FAST-41 schedule compliance and adds a dedicated Public Engagement Events object for legally required public involvement documentation.
- **Future extensibility**: Designed to grow with your permitting system — providing a scalable foundation for GIS integration, CE screening logic, process modeling, and decision payloads.

Whether you're beginning a modernization journey or enhancing an existing permitting solution, this Accelerator gives you the head start needed to meet federal standards and accelerate public outcomes.


## CEQ Standard Coverage

This Accelerator implements the following entities from the CEQ NEPA and Permitting Data and Technology Standard v1.2:

| CEQ Entity | Salesforce Object | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Entity 1: Project | `Program` | ✅ Implemented |
| Entity 2: Process | `IndividualApplication` | ✅ Implemented |
| Entity 3: Documents | `ContentVersion` (record type: `nepa_permit_document`) | ✅ Implemented |
| Entity 4: Comments | `PublicComplaint` | ✅ Implemented |
| Entity 5: Public Engagement Events | `nepa_engagement__c` (custom) | ✅ Implemented |
| Entity 6: Case Events | `ApplicationTimeline` (PSS standard, extended) | ✅ Implemented |
| Entity 7: GIS Data | PSS `Polygon` (not yet linked) | 🔲 Tier 3 / v2.0 |
| Entity 8: User Role | Salesforce standard profiles/roles | 🔲 Use native Salesforce |
| Entity 9: Legal Structure | — | 🔲 Tier 3 / v2.0 |

All 6 implemented entities include the 5 custom provenance fields required by CEQ standard v1.2 (`Data Record Version`, `Data Source Agency`, `Data Source System`, `Record Owner Agency`, `Retrieved Timestamp`). `LastModifiedDate` (native Salesforce) satisfies the standard's `Last Updated` provenance property.

## CEQ-Compliant Data Export

This Accelerator includes an OmniStudio Integration Procedure that exports Salesforce permitting data as a CEQ standard v1.2-compliant JSON payload, supporting **MFR #2 (Data Sharing)** at the Emerging maturity level.

### How it works

The Integration Procedure `NEPA/CEQExport` accepts a `projectId` (the Salesforce `Program` record ID) and returns a nested JSON object containing all 6 implemented CEQ entities for that project.

**Output structure:**
```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.2",
  "standard": "CEQ NEPA and Permitting Data and Technology Standard",
  "exported_at": "2026-04-29T00:00:00Z",
  "project": {
    "id": "...",
    "project_id": "<UUID>",
    "project_title": "...",
    "processes": [
      {
        "federal_unique_id": "<UUID>",
        "nepa_review_type": "EIS",
        "status": "in progress",
        "documents": [
          {
            "document_type": "Draft EIS",
            "comments": [...]
          }
        ],
        "public_engagement_events": [...],
        "case_events": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Setup

1. **Activate DataRaptors**: In OmniStudio → DataRaptors, activate all 6 `DR_Extract_NEPA_*` DataRaptor Extracts.
2. **Activate Integration Procedure**: In OmniStudio → Integration Procedures, activate `NEPA/CEQExport`.
3. **Create API Action** (optional, for REST exposure):
   - Go to OmniStudio → API Actions → New
   - Name: `NEPA_CEQExport_API`
   - Method: `POST`; Custom API Name: `nepa_ceq_export`
   - Link to IP: `NEPA/CEQExport/English/1`
   - Map `projectId` from request body → IP input; map `CEQPayload` from IP output → response body
4. **Call the endpoint**:
   ```
   POST /services/apexrest/omnistudio/v1/integrationprocedure/NEPA_CEQExport
   Authorization: Bearer <session_token>
   Content-Type: application/json

   { "projectId": "001xx0000000001AAA" }
   ```

> **Note:** OmniStudio (formerly Vlocity) must be installed in your org. The Integration Procedure and DataRaptor metadata files are included in this package and can be deployed via SFDX. If you do not have OmniStudio, you can implement equivalent export logic using Apex or Flow.


## PSS Dependency

This Accelerator is built on **Salesforce Public Sector Solutions (PSS)** and depends on three PSS standard objects that are not available in a standard Salesforce org:

| PSS Object | CEQ Entity | Dependency |
|---|---|---|
| `IndividualApplication` | Entity 2: Process | All 11 automation flows, permission set FLS, OmniStudio DataRaptor |
| `Program` | Entity 1: Project | Litigation risk scoring, CE screener, DataRaptor extract |
| `ApplicationTimeline` | Entity 6: Case Events | CE Determination Router, Timeline Risk Assessor, Admin Record Checker |

**If your org does not have PSS installed**, you will need to substitute these objects before deploying:

1. **`IndividualApplication`** — replace with a custom object (e.g., `NEPA_Process__c`) or a standard object such as `Case`. Update every flow's `Get_IndividualApplication` recordLookup, all `inputAssignments` writing to `IndividualApplicationId`, and all `fieldPermissions` referencing `IndividualApplication.*` in the permission set.
2. **`Program`** — replace with a custom object or `Account`. Update the Litigation Risk Scorer's `Get_RelatedProject` lookup and the `nepa_related_project__c` lookup field on `IndividualApplication`.
3. **`ApplicationTimeline`** — replace with a custom child object. Update the `IndividualApplicationId` master-detail field name and the `nepa_related_case_event__c` lookup on `ContentVersion`.

The three custom objects (`nepa_engagement__c`, `nepa_litigation__c`, `nepa_process_related_agencies__c`) and all custom metadata types are PSS-independent and deploy without modification.

**Installing PSS**: A free PSS developer org is available at the [PSS trial link](https://developer.salesforce.com/free-trials/comparison/public-sector) listed in Before You Install below. This is the recommended path — substituting the PSS objects removes access to PSS-native features such as Action Plans, OmniStudio, and the Application and Authorization data model relationships that the CEQ export relies on.


## Data Model Notes

**Process status values** align with the CEQ standard: `planned | pre-application | in progress | paused | completed | cancelled`. These are intentionally not enumerated in the standard to allow agency flexibility — the picklist values provided are recommended defaults.

**External IDs**: `Program.nepa_project_id__c` and `IndividualApplication.nepa_federal_unique_id__c` are declared as External ID fields to support upsert operations from external agency systems. CEQ recommends UUID format for global uniqueness; field length is set to 36 characters accordingly.

**Comments as children of documents**: Per the CEQ standard Entity Relationship Diagram (Figure 1), `PublicComplaint` records should be linked to a specific `ContentVersion` document (e.g., a Draft EIS) via `nepa_parent_document__c`. The existing relationship to `IndividualApplication` may be retained for reporting convenience.

**Provenance fields**: The 5 custom provenance fields (`nepa_data_record_version__c`, `nepa_data_source_agency__c`, `nepa_data_source_system__c`, `nepa_record_owner_agency__c`, `nepa_retrieved_timestamp__c`) are present on all 6 implemented entities. `LastModifiedDate` (native) satisfies the standard's `Last Updated` property; no custom field is needed for it.

**Document type picklist**: The `nepa_document_type__c` picklist on `ContentVersion` includes: NOI, Draft EIS, Supplemental EIS, Programmatic EIS, Final EIS, ROD, Environmental Assessment, FONSI, CE Determination, Memorandum to File, Permit, Other.

**Multi-value text fields**: `Program.nepa_project_sector__c` and `Program.nepa_project_type__c` are LongTextArea fields that support multiple values separated by semicolons. Many real-world NEPA projects span multiple sectors and project types simultaneously (e.g., a resource management plan covering energy, land use, transportation, water, and agriculture). The CEQ standard does not restrict these to single values.

**Main document flag**: `ContentVersion.nepa_main_document__c` (Checkbox) distinguishes the primary document body from supporting files. Set to `true` for the main EIS/EA/CE document; `false` for appendices, attachments, maps, and supplemental files. Aligns with the NEPATEC2.0 corpus `main_document` field.

**Object choice — `IndividualApplication` vs. `BusinessLicenseApplication`**: The PSS standard object chosen for CEQ Entity 2 (Process) is `IndividualApplication`, not `BusinessLicenseApplication`. This is intentional. NEPA proponents include individuals, joint ventures, tribes, federal agencies, and businesses — not exclusively commercial entities — so `BusinessLicenseApplication`'s business-licensing assumptions (renewal cycles, license numbers, business entity links) do not fit the NEPA process lifecycle. `IndividualApplication` carries the stage, status, and outcome workflow fields that map directly to CEQ's Process entity properties. The PSS object label can be overridden to "NEPA Process" or "Permit Application" in Setup → Object Manager without changing the API name or any downstream metadata.
